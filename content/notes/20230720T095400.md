feedly 는 아마 비슷한 개념이다. 분야 별 검색이 되니까.

👋 Hello there!
This site is a blogroll based on revskill's Ask HN thread "Could you share your personal blog here?"

I quickly hacked it together following the thread on HN where over a thousand users were sharing their blogs. Essentially, I now have a curated list of public domain knowledge that could keep me reading forever. I thought I might as well put the link out there.

A cron job checks the thread every six hours. I plan to add the ability to submit blogs and, hopefully, to edit the descriptions as well (for the blog owners).

I'm backlogging all the site's suggestions from the HN thread, but if you want to send more ideas or comments, you can write to nelson@hernandez.id

The stack? Rails 7 + Tabler UI / Gems: Nokogiri, Ransack, Kaminari, Sidekiq.
