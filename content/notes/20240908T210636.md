\#가이드 Logic Matters


## (“Logic Matters: The Study Guide and Book Notes 논리학 가이드” 2014) {#logic-matters-the-study-guide-and-book-notes-논리학-가이드-2014}

-   A Study Guide A re-titled, expanded version of the old Teach Yourself Logic study guide. This is a book length guide to the main topics and some suitable texts either for teaching yourself logic by individual self-study, or to supplement a university course. You only need to read just the first half-dozen pages to see […]

## 목차 {#목차}

Preface 1 The Guide, and how to use it 1.1 Who is the Guide for? 1.2 The Guide’s structure 1.3 Strategies for self-teaching from logic books 1.4 Choices, choices 1.5 So what do you need to bring to the party? 1.6 Two notational conventions 2 A very little informal set theory 2.1 Sets: a very quick checklist 2.2 A note about naivety 2.3 Recommendations on informal basic set theory 2.4 Virtual classes, real sets 3 First-order logic 3.1 Propositional logic 3.2 FOL basics 3.3 A little more about types of proof-system 3.4 Basic recommendations for reading on FOL 3.5 Some parallel and slightly more advanced reading 3.6 A little history (and some philosophy too) 3.7 Postscript: Other treatments? 4 Second-order logic, quite briefly 4.1 A preliminary note on many-sorted logic 4.2 Second-order logic 4.3 Recommendations on many-sorted and second-order logic 4.4 Conceptual issues 5 Model theory 5.1 Elementary model theory 5.2 Recommendations for beginning first-order model theory 5.3 Some parallel and slightly more advanced reading 5.4 A little history 6 Arithmetic, computability, and incompleteness 6.1 Logic and computabilit 6.2 Computable functions 6.3 Formal arithmetic 6.4 Towards Gödelian incompleteness 6.5 Main recommendations on arithmetic, etc. 6.6 Some parallel/additional reading 6.7 A little history 7 Set theory, less naively 7.1 Set theory and number systems 7.2 Ordinals, cardinals, and more 7.3 Main recommendations on set theory 7.4 Some parallel/additional reading on standard ZFC 7.5 Further conceptual reflection on set theories 7.6 A little more history 7.7 Postscript: Other treatments? 8 Intuitionistic logic 8.1 A formal system 8.2 Why intuitionistic logic? 8.3 More proof theory, more semantics 8.4 Basic recommendations on intuitionistic logic 8.5 Some parallel/additional reading 8.6 A little more history, a little more philosophy 9 Elementary proof theory 9.1 Preamble: a very little about Hilbert’s Programme 9.2 Deductive systems, normal forms, and cuts 9.3 Proof theory and the consistency of arithmetic 9.4 Main recommendations on elementary proof theory 9.5 Some parallel/additional reading 10 Modal logics 10.1 Some basic modal logics 10.2 Provability logic 10.3 First readings on modal logic 10.4 Suggested readings on provability logic 10.5 Alternative and further readings on modal logics 10.6 Finally, a very little history 11 Other logics? 11.1 Relevant logic 11.2 Readings on relevant logic 11.3 Free logic 11.4 Readings on free logic 11.5 Plural logic 11.6 Readings on plural logic 12 Going further 12.1 A very little light algebra for logic? 12.2 More model theory

12.3 More on formal arithmetic and computability 12.4 More on mainstream set theory 12.5 Choice, and the choice of set theory 12.6 More proof theory 12.7 Higher-order logic, the lambda calculus, and type theory
