## 도서 소개 : 왜 함수형 프로그래밍과 물리학이 만나야 하는가 {#도서-소개-왜-함수형-프로그래밍과-물리학이-만나야-하는가}

This book teaches you to solve physics problems using the functional programming paradigm. Ideal for first-time programmers and science aficionados alike, it introduces the Haskell programming language and encourages the writing of beautiful code to match the elegant ideas of theoretical physics.

이 책은 함수형 프로그래밍 패러다임을 사용하여 물리학 문제를 해결하는 방법을 알려줍니다. 초보 프로그래머와 과학 애호가 모두에게 이상적인 이 책은 하스켈 프로그래밍 언어를 소개하고 이론 물리학의 우아한 아이디어에 맞는 아름다운 코드를 작성하도록 장려합니다.

Early chapters cover the basics of coding in Haskell, which has a powerful system of types capable of encoding important mathematical structures in physics, like vectors, derivatives, integrals, scalar fields, vector fields, and differential equations. Later sections of the book explore Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetics—two central pillars of theoretical physics. In addition, you’ll get a deep look into source code, and discover why Haskell’s high-order functions and referential transparency serve physics so well. Along the way, you’ll learn:

초반 장에서는 벡터, 미분, 적분, 스칼라 필드, 벡터 필드, 미분 방정식 등 물리학의 중요한 수학적 구조를 인코딩할 수 있는 강력한 유형 시스템을 갖춘 하스켈 코딩의 기초를 다룹니다. 책의 후반부에서는 이론 물리학의 두 가지 중심 축인 뉴턴 역학과 전자기학을 살펴봅니다. 또한 소스 코드를 자세히 살펴보고 하스켈의 고차 함수와 참조 투명성이 물리학에 유용한 이유를 알아볼 수 있습니다. 그 과정에서 많은 것을 배우게 될 것입니다:

•How to write beautiful code that expresses fundamental physical principles -기본적인 물리적 원리를 표현하는 아름다운 코드를 작성하는 방법 •How to make graphs and animations of interesting situations -흥미로운 상황의 그래프와 애니메이션을 만드는 방법 •How to program in a language that looks like mathematics -수학처럼 보이는 언어로 프로그래밍하는 방법 •How types, high order functions, and referential transparency serve physics well -타입, 고차 함수, 레퍼런스 투명성이 물리학에 어떻게 도움이 되는가?

APPENDIX: INSTALLING HASKELL

[:하스켈]({{< relref "/notes/20240621T082931.md" >}}) 문서를 참고. 생각보다 옵션이 많기에 복잡하다.


### Installing GHC {#installing-ghc}

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) is the Haskell compiler we use in this book. It is free, open source software anyone can download and install.


### Installing a Text Editor {#installing-a-text-editor}

[:텍스트-에디터 :편집기]({{< relref "/notes/20240614T090202.md" >}})


### Installing Gnuplot {#installing-gnuplot}

[:데이터-시각화 :인포그래픽 - 맷플롯립 그누플롯]({{< relref "/notes/20240623T204539.md" >}}) 측면에서 중요하다.

설치 한다.

```text
$ sudo apt install gnuplot
```

gnuplot 를 실행

```text
gnuplot> plot cos(x)
```

and a window containing a plot should pop open. Once you succeed in installing the gnuplot program, you are ready to install the Haskell gnuplot package, which lets you control gnuplot from Haskell.
