-   2023 "Completion at Point Function (CAPF) for Org-Mode Links" : 버퍼에 이미 있는 링크를 완성해주는 것임 (“Completion at Point Function (CAPF) for Org-Mode Links” 2023) I write a lot of things using Org-Mode. One function I have wanted is auto-completion of links that already exist in the current Org-Mode buffer. (Sidenote: I have created custom links for abbreviations, epigraphs, dates, and glossary of terms. ) Last night I spent a bit of time writing that function. I remembered Org-Roam’s completion functions, so I started there for inspiration. Writing Some Emacs Lisp I looked to org-roam-complete-link-at-point for inspiration. I need a function that returns the text of the links. Along with the text, I would need the raw-link.
